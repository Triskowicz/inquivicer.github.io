        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Tristan Korasadowicz and I am a 21 year old technical engineering student. Born and 
            raised in America, Virginia I later moved to the netherlands in order to pursue my education. 
            Being tech-savvy and inqusitive are my strongest attributes leading to the reason behind 
            this websites creation. Many topics interest me so I would define myself as a jack of all 
            trades.
        </p>

        <h1>This Website</h1>
        <p>
            I made this website for the purposes of a digital journal where my work can be displayed in 
            one place. It may not be the prettiest website now, but that will change in the future as 
            my experience grows. As do all other websites on the internet this one is being coded using
            the programming languages HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The code is then pushed onto GitHub 
            where it is hosted with a custom domain.
